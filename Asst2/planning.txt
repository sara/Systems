Step 1: recursively touch each file in directory structure
Step 2: on each file, work within original, master hash table
	- 36 slots, one for each letter of alphabet and digit
	- lower case-ify each word, scatter into hash table by token
	- if you find more than one of a single token in the same file, do not add a new node, but simply increment the corresponding node
	- maintain multiple nodes of the same token only for different files
Step 3: Keep going as long as MASTER hash table has entries
	- collect items in groups from the master hash table, removing as you go, one token at a time
	- track maximum number of repeats per token
	- create new SECONDARY hash table with as many indexes as maximum # of repeats
	- scatter nodes into hash table with indexe # corresponding to # of repeats
	- internally (by index) use alnum sort if you get different files with the same number of occurences
	- when finished sorting, output results to output file and get rid of SECONDARY hash table
